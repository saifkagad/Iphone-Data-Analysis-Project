# Iphone-Data-Analysis-Project

In this project, I have imported a CSV file containing data on iPhones. 
Using this data, I have conducted an analysis to extract useful insights from the data source file.
The Python file includes all the basics, such as reading the CSV file, creating a DataFrame from it, and applying functions to analyze the data for useful insights.
